              <li>User's Review :- Prison Break was the first tv series that I watched. I definitely liked the idea. Now, given that I had watched Shawshank redemption before that, initially I just felt it was a longer version of that (you know, just one of those things they drag into a series).
                  But I guess I was wrong !!!
                  The first 3 seasons were really amazing. Although there story moves at a very slow pace, it was quite captivating. So much so that I decided to skip school that day and binge an entire season.
                  I definitely love the cast. Especially, the role of a character called Theodore Bagwell (t-bag). The fourth season is not really “prison break”and received quite some amount of hate. However, I feel it was okay. The fifth season which was released recently almost after 7 years, was a brilliant season.        
                  All in all, I feel that it's a good show to watch. I would definitely suggest you to watch the show !!!</li>

          <h3>9. The Walking Dead</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>IDMB Rating :- 8.3/10</li>
              <li>Type :- Drama, Horror, Thriller</li>
              <li>Language :- English</li>

              <li>User's Review :- it is an excellent premise that suffers from terrible writing. Every episode has to end with an unnecessary cliff hanger.
                  Zombies make more noise than Hitler on a 6 day taco binge but are constantly ninja-ing their way to the main characters. All this happens just to add a bit of drama. Most of these close encounters shouldn’t happen.
                  Pacing of the show is…terrible. While I understand not everything can be guns blazing, but it feels like they blow half heir budget on a couple scenes and then have to fluff the rest. How long did they spend at the prison? 2–2.5 seasons? Suddenly all character development stopped and nothing happened besides creating petty drama with the governor. Then towards terminus, the show picked up again…then stopped.          
                  One of the biggest problems is how terrible the characters are written. I’ve never seen a show where the bad guys are the only people who make a lick of sense and have some consistency where the “good guys” main cast were a bunch of bumbling idiots. It is a bit painful instinctively knowing Rick et al are going to come out on the winning end because the plot demands it.          
                  The good guys are TERRIBLY written. Their motivations are wildly inconsistent. One moment they’re ripping a zombie to shreds and slathering themselves in its ooze and the next they’re having a crisis of faith because one was wearing a cute shirt. They constantly make one boneheaded decision after another because the plot demands it then act surprised when an obviously stupid choice backfires.          
                  The bad guys…I always end up siding with. The Governor, while a narcissist, has a lot of commonsense put behind him. Why he does what he does. The group Daryl rolled with? Again, simple and well-done but fail because of plot twist. Negan? Negan makes perfect sense. His character is well-done. His motivations are clear…in the end we know he’ll fall.</li>

            <h3>8. Money Heist</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>IDMB Rating :- 8.5/10</li>
                <li>Type :- Action, Crime, Mystry</li>

                <li>User's Review :- I loved the first 2 series. It was a very well thought out, directed, acted, written show. The characters were believable and unique, and the responses from authority were also very realistic to me ( But I am not in the military ). The only small drawback was it sometimes got bogged down in petty drama. It felt they were using small drama to stretch out the plot. 9/10
                    Series three though seemed to me to be slightly over sensationalized. The choices of characters were more questionable. It also seemed to me that they were trying too hard to make the Professor’s gang seem like the ‘good’ guys.            
                    This was clearly defined in the scene where Palermo started beating one of the captives and there was opposition to it. Obviously going into a heist, these people are professionals and would know that sometimes a show of aggression such as this is necessary for the outcome. But the scene tried to make them show non-aggressive. I think it would have been better to err on the side of realism, rather than forcing the viewer to empathize with the criminals. The viewpoint is from their perspective anyway, so a natural empathy occurs.            
                    Season 3 was still good, but I also noticed characters developing plot armor. It didn’t do enough to subvert my expectations to warrant it being as good as the first two series. 8/10</li>

            <h3>7. Dexter</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>IDMB Rating :- 8.7/10</li>
                <li>Type :- Crime, Drama, Mystry</li>

                <li>Total Number Of Episodes :- 96</li>
                <li>User's Review :- It is very hard for a Dexter fan to explain what he likes most in this gripping series. This is just my attempt to count some of the reasons why I preferred the blood spatter analyst aka moonlight serial killer over my sleep.
                    Some may say thrill is the reason to watch it, but unlike other tv series (Prison break, Vampire dairies etc.) they do not create suspense toward the end of series. Dexter mostly end the episode on a happy note but still can cause shivering in your spine.
                    It has a story of vigilante which can thrill you if you are their great fan (I will highly recommend it for Batman fans).
                    The Dialogues of the series are well edited and Michael justify them by excellent dialogue delivery.
                    The episodes are fine work of art and will give you glimpse of Nolan's work especially the sixth season.
                    Brilliant star cast Michael C Hall, and Exorcism of Emily rose star Jennifer Carpenter do not needs introduction even the rest of the crew has done brilliant job especially Masuka in his comic role.
                    The series is built in the way that you will find yourself attached to Dexter. Even some of you will find the Dark passenger in you (you will understand term dark passenger on watching the series)
                    Dexter is portrayed as emotionless person but still the series has emotional scenes regarding father-son, brother-sister, husband-wife relations involving Dexter in each but don't worry they won't make you cry.
                    Watching Dexter on his hunt or in his lab will show you classic Sherlock especially when he explains the murder by just watching the spatter of blood.
                    Background score is the another charm.
                    Last but not the least, you may find the sensuous scenes redundant because you are so involved in the story they seem distracting (you may be smiling now but it is true).</li>

                <li>User's Review :- It is the televisic equivalent of coitus interruptus…. much shouting, menacing, threatening and stomping about, but never any follow-through. I’ve never seen so many guns get pulled on screen without shots being fired. It is all huff and puff and no houses getting blown down… by some of the finest actors around. And while watching them you very much get the impression that they are A C T I N G!! (Master Thespian voice there). </li>

                <li>Total Number Of Episodes :- 30</li>
                <li>User's Review :-  In many TV shows, having only English speaking actors in say Mexico is really bad for immersion. That's not the case with Narcos. The show combines English when DEA agents are present and Spanish as the standard.
                    Many journalists reported that the Spanish of some actors, including the protagonist, isn't very good. That must be very cringy for Spanish speaking viewers. That isn't much of a problem to me who understands the very basic of that language, so the actors accent is good enough.            
                    You won't find terribly long and boring moments during an episode for which The Walking Dead is infamous. Narcos describes narcotrafficking in the mind of psychopath entrepreneur. It's exhilarating and terrifying. It makes you wonder what kind of tactic the narcotraffickers are going to use next to overwhelm their adversaries.</li>

                <li>User's Review :-  The Netflix Original Series Stranger Things is a loving homage to the storytelling of the 1980s. The 1980s belonged to two storytellers – Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. Stranger Things is an interpretative amalgam of their works. It is a jigsaw puzzle in which the pieces are E.T., Goonies, Firestarter, The Explorers, Poltergeist, Stand by Me, Carrie, and Aliens.</li>

                  <li>User's Review :- Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: "No thank you" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see "Breaking Bad" again. I can't wait.</li>
